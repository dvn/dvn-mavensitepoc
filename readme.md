http://dvn.github.com/dvn-mavensitepoc is a Proof of Concept for a Maven site for the Dataverse Network inspired by http://cescoffier.github.com/maven-play2-plugin/maven/snapshot which is backed by https://github.com/cescoffier/maven-play2-plugin

You'll see many references to maven-play2-plugin in this git repo because `mvn site:site` (used to build the site) won't run without some of the files there.
